Load Packages and Data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

kings <- read.csv("./data/danish_monarchs.csv")
```

Create duration of rule column
```{r}
# create column
kings <- kings %>% 
  mutate("days_ruling" = (reign_end - reign_start)*365)

# add extra day for every four years ruled to account for leap year
kings$days_ruling <- kings$days_ruling + round(((kings$days_ruling/365)/4), 0)
```

Calculating mean and median duration rule
```{r}
mean(na.omit(kings$days_ruling))
median(na.omit(kings$days_ruling))
```
Mean number of rule was 7045 days (19.3 years)
Mediuan number of rule was 6027 days (16.5 years)

Finding top three monarchs ruling the longest and how long they ruled
```{r}
head(kings[order(kings$days_ruling, decreasing = TRUE),], 3)
```
From this we see that the top 3 longest rulers are:
1. Christian 4. (21915 days, 60 years)
2. Erik 7. af Pommern (16071 days, 44 years)
3. Christian 9. (15706 days, 43 years)
